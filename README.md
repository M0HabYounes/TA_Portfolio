# Technical Artist Portfolio

Welcome to my Technical Artist portfolio! Here, I showcase tools I’ve developed to enhance VFX workflows with a focus on automation and efficiency.

## Tools

### 1. AML (Arnold Maps Linker)

A Python script designed to streamline texture workflows by automating the linking of texture maps.

#### Features:
1. **Automatic Texture Linking**  
   - Select a BaseColor map, and the tool links related textures automatically (e.g., Roughness, Normal, Metallic).  

2. **Name Manager UI**  
   - Manage naming conventions through an intuitive user interface—no manual JSON editing required:  
     - **Add/Delete Texture Names**  
     - **Toggle "Prefer EXR"** for displacement maps.  
     - **Enable/Disable UDIM Workflow Support**  

3. **LOD Selection**  
   - Automatically selects LOD0 for textures with multiple levels of detail.  

4. **Compatibility**  
   - Supports Python 2.7+ and works with Maya 2017 and newer.
