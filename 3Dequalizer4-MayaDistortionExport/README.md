## Overview

This project holds a special place in my heart as it features my very first script—an edit on the standard Maya export script from 3DEqualizer.It automates exports and saves valuable time, making it a personal milestone and a cornerstone of my learning journey. While I can't share too many specifics, the essence of its functionality is captured below.

## Tools

### 1. **Distortion Export Script**
An enhanced version of the default MEL script in 3DEqualizer, tailored for pipeline efficiency:
- **Overscan Calculations**: Automatically computes overscan values for precise exports.
- **Redesigned GUI**: Offers an intuitive interface, making the export process smoother and more user-friendly.

### 2. **Render Undistorted Plate**
A one-click solution to render undistorted plates.



> **Fun Fact**: This was my very first script, and it remains a personal favorite—a testament to where my journey began.
